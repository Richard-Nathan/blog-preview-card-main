## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
I'm not sure if my tag choices were the best, but I tried to use flexbox as much as possible in these codes.

I had to add height to the body so that the baseboard would be at the bottom with the flex
```css
body {
    background-color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    height: 150vh;
    justify-content: space-between;
}
```


### Continued development

I want to continue learing more about flexbox and grid(which i probably will start soon), I need to improve the way I create css classes, I still think the names I create are a little bad.
